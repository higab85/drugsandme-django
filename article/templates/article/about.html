          You've set your heart on a drug, here's about gettting it to ensure
          a maximal chance of getting what you asked for.

          <h3>Plan ahead</h3>
          <p>
            It’s best to get your drugs ahead of time to avoid rash decisions and
            buying from random unknown suppliers.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <img src="http://placekitten.com/100/100" alt="">
          <h3>Know your supplier</h3>
          <p>
            If you’ve never bought from them yourself, at least make sure they
            come recommended from someone you know. The optimum scenario is buying
            from a tried and tested supplier; be wary of new sources. It just
            means that you’re less likely to be ripped off be it quantity or
            quality/purity wise. This also means that you should be careful of how
            much you take with a new supplier as outlined in the
            <a href="#dosing">dosing section</a>.

        <div>
          <img src="http://placekitten.com/100/100" alt="">
          <h3>Know the product</h3>
          <p>
            Get an idea of what the product looks like, talk to friends, visit our
            page on the drug, use resources like google images so that you can
            make a preliminary assessment of the drug upon purchase and be able to
            know if you’re being sold tea instead of cannabis.
          </p>

          <img src="http://placekitten.com/100/100" alt="">
          <h3>Know the price</h3>
          <p>
            Get a handle on current prices, again using peers and online
            resources so that you know vaguely what to expect. Too much drugs for
            too little money is just as suspicious as too little.

        <h3>Use testing kits</h3>
        <p>
          These will help you verify that what you have in hand is what you asked
          for, its purity and the presence of cutting agents. These aren’t
          fool-proof but it’s a start!
        </p>
        <p>
          It is interesting to note that pills may be a safer option in the long
          term, with official bodies becoming more aware of the actual dangers of
          drugs there is better reporting of known dangers. What this means in
          effect is that with a pill, which often has a recognisable mark upon it,
          you can verify websites to see if the pill you have has been reported as
          dangerous, whereas with a powder, there is no trace and it is hard to
          get any idea of what actually is inside the baggie.
