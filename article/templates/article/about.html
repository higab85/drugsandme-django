        Drugsand.me is an educational website that teaches about the existing
        harm reduction methods for drug users. We do not promote drug use, but
        we do encourage to be safe if you are thinking of taking any kind of
        drug. This website was inspired by the thousands of deaths that occur
        in the UK due lack of correct drug education. Existing websites provide
        excellent information on drugs, but have a falsely optimistic approach
        thinking that the people reading those sites will become discouraged
        after reading about the effects or potential health risks. This is not
        the reality.

        At Drugsand.me we aim to provide an informational hub where to find
        information for drug users who would like to be safer. We want to
        provide a simple website to find essential information from varied
        sources, including scientists and the internet community. Although we
        have done thorough research to find this information, you should not
        count solely on this site and do your own research. As with everything,
        you shouldn't trust the first source you bump into. We have a
        bibliography that we encourage you to read.

      <h2 class="section-title">A word about the information in this website:</h2>
      <p>
        The content in this webpage is obtained, whenever information was
        found, from scientific and evidence-based resources. However, there are
        many gaps where a lot of research needs to be done, not because there
        isnÂ´t interest in the scientific literature, but because drug policies
        limit controlled research on drugs considered as recreational ones.
        Wherever scientific-based information was not found, as many as
        possible resources were compared and contrasted to provide the most
        accurate and useful piece of advice/information.
      </p>
      <p>
        From drugsand.me we want to support researchers, institutes and
        foundations that are investing time and money in scientific research
        into psychoactive drugs, seeking for consciousness and health-oriented
        drug policy reform.

        Prior knowledge on drugs and other rewarding habits have been shown to
        directly diminish the brain alluring by them, so (most probably) the
        propensity to develop an addiction (
