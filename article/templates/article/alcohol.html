  <p>
    Alcohol, or ethanol, is the most commonly used recreational drug in the world
    due to its legal status in most countries. This allows for labelling of
    alcoholic products by a % alcohol by volume, which allows the person drinking
    it to know if the drink is strong or not. Alcohol has been consumed for
    centuries, however, recent advances in neuroscience show the severe
    consequences of alcohol intoxication.

    <h3>How Much? WHEN? How Long? – need rephrasing, make it more precise and concise</h3>
    <p>
      As with any drug the dose and effect on people depends on many aspects
      such asweight, metabolism, past experience and context (e.g. consumption
      of equivalent drugs recently). Alcohol is metabolised relatively fast,
      however, itis more difficult for the body to get ridof the toxins with
      increasing doses. Therefore, we suggest to limit your dose if you want
      tobe on the safe side!
    <h3>Recommended doses</h3>
    <p>
      Men and women are advised not to regularly drink more than 14 units a week.
      Spread your drinking over three days or more if you drink as much as14
      units a week.
    </p>
  <h4>How many units of alcohol are in your drink?</h4>

  <h3>Method of administration</h3>
  <p>
    The most common method to ingest alcohol is orally, however, recently people
    have been inhaling alcohol as well. If you want to learn more about how the
    method ofadministration affects you, read our Essentials page.
  </p>
  <p>Orally:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <h5>Total duration</h5>
      <p>1.5 - 3 hrs</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h5>Onset</h5>
      <p>15 - 30 mins</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h5>Coming up</h5>
      <p>15 - 20 mins</p>
    </li>
    <li>

      <p>30 - 90 mins</p>

  <li>
    Don’t drink and drive. As easy asit sounds, people still do it,
    causing hundreds of thousands of deaths per year.
  </li>
  <li>
    Avoid drinking out of impulse because of reaction to anger, this can lead
    tobad drinking episodes.
  </li>
  <li>
    Control the amount of drinks you have and the speed by which you drink
    them if you are susceptible to blackouts.
  </li>
  <li>
    To control for diseases such as cancer, the best policy isto reduce the
    amount of alcohol that is taken. You can do this by counting the drinks
    you have in a day and set targets to reduce them.
  </li>
  <li>
    Avoid getting drinks spiked with other drugs in
    <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Avoid-Spiked-Drinks">simple steps</a>
  </li>
</ol>
<h3>In an emergency or overdose</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Stay calm and try to not look anxiousin front of the person</li>
  <li>
    Before approaching or touching the person, explain what you intend todoin
    a direct and reassuring manner.
  </li>
  <li>
    Keep the person still and comfortable. Don't let him/her walk alone.
  </li>
  <li>
    Do not administer any food, drink or medication --including aspirin or
    vitamins --which may cause stomach distress.
  </li>
  <li>Do not ridicule or threaten the person.</li>
  <li>
    Do not let the person sleep on his/her back. Death from choking on
    inhaled vomit may result. Place the person on his/her side, with one arm
    extended above the head. Keep a sober person nearby to watch for signs of
    trouble.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  <br>Important:</br>Remember, only time will help to sober a person who is
  intoxicated. Walking, black coffee or a cold shower will not help. Drink
  plenty of water to avoid dehydration, and reduce the hangover.
</p>
<h4>Seek medical attention if:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>The person is unconscious and cannot be wakened</li>
  <li>Breathing is irregular and/or shallow</li>
  <li>You suspect alcohol has been mixed with other drugs</li>
  <li>Skin is clammy or pale</li>
  <li>Blood in vomit</li>

  Bad alcohol hangovers are considered tobe worse than the day-after effects of
  nearly any other drug. Alcohol causes liver damage and bad hangovers may
  indicate alcohol toxicity and should be avoided
</p>
<p>
  Occasional drinkers are more likely to get bad hangovers than regular ones.
</p>
<p>
  They usually last for 1-36 hours.
</p>
<p>
  The after effects include:
  <ol>
    <li>Headache</li>
    <li>Bad mood</li>
    <li>Thirst</li>
    <li>Nausea, vomiting, and/or dry-heaves</li>
    <li>Dizziness that becomes worse with movement</li>
    <li>Loud noises and bright lights cause pain/discomfort</li>
    <li>Inability to think clearly </li>
    <li>Muscle fatigue and pain</li>
    <li>Sweating and tremors</li>
  </ol>
  Source: <a href="https://www.erowid.org/chemicals/alcohol/alcohol_hangover.shtml">Erowid</a>
</p>
<p>
  The best way to reduce hangover effects isto drink water before, during and
  after the night. However, this will not completely remove itasitis not just
  caused bydehydration.
</p>
<p>
  Regarding vitamin B supplements, there isno evidence that these actually
  ‘cure’ hangovers, although will probably work as a placebo!
