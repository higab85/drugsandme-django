<p>
  Cocaine is a stimulant that gives you a quick euphoric feeling. It is
  extracted from the leaves of a cocoa plant and these leaves have been chewed
  or drank as tea for centuries in South America. Nowadays, cocaine comes
  either in the form of white powder or as a ‘crack’ rock. The intensity of
  effects and potential for abuse vary greatly depending on the form of cocaine
  you take.
</p>
<p>
  It is the second most consumed recreational drug worldwide, with cannabis
  being the first. However, without proper care and responsibility, cocaine
  can be highly addictive and dangerous due to the intense and short lived
  induced euphoria.

  <h3 class="funky">Avoid alcohol</h3>
  <p class="hidden">
    Avoid drinking alcohol when doing cocaine. The combination leads to the
    production of a toxic chemical, cocaethylene, that is extremely
    <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9243342">harmful to your liver</a>.

  <h3 class="funky"> Check the purity</h3>

  <h3>How? How much? When? For how long?</h3>
  <div class="side-note">
    <p>
      Read our section on dosing and tolerance in <a href="/me">ME</a> for more
      information.
    </p>
  </div>
  <p>
    As with any drug, the correct dose for you depends on factors such as
    weight, gender, metabolism, whether you have taken the drug recently or
    not, amongst many others.
  </p>
  <p>
    The amount of cocaine you should take and the time it takes for the effects
    to kick in depends greatly on the purity and cutting agents mixed in. We
    highly advise you to test your cocaine before using it.
    The advice provided below are based on the effects of pure cocaine.
    However, we understand that it is extremely difficult to find pure cocaine,
    so start off small and see how you feel.

  </p>
  <h3>How you take it matters...</h3>
  <h4>Powdered Cocaine</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Snorting</strong> is the most common way of using it. People
        usually divide the powder out into lines with a card and snort it with
        a straw or a piece of paper (maybe diagram with a card and lines).
        Snorting through one nostril over a long time can lead to nasal ulcers
        or damage the septum.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Gumming</strong> is another popular way of doing it. A small
        amount is applied on the upper and lower inside of the lips and the
        gum. Your lips and gums might feel numb from the cocaine. Gumming can
        damage your gums and lips.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Crack cocaine</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Smoked</strong> is the only way to use crack cocaine. It is
        usually smoked using a crack pipe. The effects of it will be felt
        immediately (10- 20 seconds) after smoking. However, it is much more
        potent and addictive than powder cocaine. It can also cause respiratory
        problems such as asthma and emphysema.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Source: Nutt, 2012</p>
  <h3>How much?</h3>
  <p>
    The purity of cocaine varies significantly from place to place and dealer
    to dealer. The cocaine that you picked up from your dealer last month might
    be completely different from the one you just picked up. So, start off
    small and increase the dose gradually.
  </p>
  <h3>When do the effect kick in and for how long?</h3>
  <p>
    The ‘START’ time below is when you will usually begin to feel the effects
    of the cocaine from the time when you first take it. The ‘DURATION’ is
    roughly the length of time you will experience the effects, after which the
    effects will start to wind off and you might start to feel the calm down
    effects.
  </p>
  <p> Snorting and gumming cocaine: </p>
  <ul>
    <li><span><strong>START:</strong> 1-3 minutes </span></li>
    <li><span><strong>DURATION:</strong> 30 minutes</span></li>
  </ul>
  <p>Smoking crack cocaine:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><span><strong>START:</strong>15 seconds</span></li>
    <li><span><strong>DURATION:</strong>15 minutes</span></li>
  </ul>

  <p class="side-note">
    Head over to our <a href="/me">ME</a> section if you would like to know
    more about harm reduction.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are certain precautions you should take before doing cocaine. The
    advice below helps you to be physically and mentally prepared before doing
    it. We want you to enjoy your experience as much as possible, but just in
    case you have a bad experience or some of the unwanted side effects, we
    have provided information on how to take care of yourself when you are in
    full swing. Finally, there are those uncomfortable or undesirable effects
    after the high have worn out, we will provide you with some practical tips
    on how to have a better calm down and help you to reduce the harm done to
    your body and brain.
  </p>
{% endblock %}

{% block harm-reduction-stage-1 %}
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      It is difficult to obtaining a 100% pure cocaine, therefore we highly
      advise you to test your drug before taking it. Powdered Cocaine is
      frequently cut with other white powder substances, such as adulterants
      and speed, to increase its volume and weight. It is extremely difficult
      to know what these other drugs and impurities might be, so for your own
      safety and wellbeing, do try to test the purity of your cocaine before
      using it. <a href="http://www.eztestkits.com/en/drug-purity-and-cutting-agents/">
        Here is also a list</a> of the common cutting agents found in cocaine.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Part of reducing the harm to your body is maintaining good hygiene.
      Before snorting the cocaine, divide it on a clean surface and snort it
      with an unused straw; try not to use a note as you never know what’s
      on it.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Injecting cocaine can cause damage to the skin and veins, which might
      lead to sores.. Sharing injecting equipment risks infections such as
      HIV, Hepatitis B and C. It is also the most addictive way of taking
      cocaine.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If you have any pre-existing heart conditions or pregnant, we strongly
      advise you to stay away from cocaine. It increases the heart rate
      significantly and can cause problems for the foetus.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
{% endblock %}

{% block harm-reduction-stage-2 %}
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        Avoid mixing cocaine with other drugs, especially alcohol. Cocaine
        makes you sober and this perception can lead to excessive binges as
        you don’t seem to get any drunker. More importantly, cocaine and
        alcohol react to form, cocaethylene (link to wiki or something), a much
        more harmful and toxic substance. Just remember not to drink too much
        when you are on cocaine.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Cocaine can make you take more risks than you usually would be
         with. It can also cloud your judgement and lead you to make irrational
         decisions. Try not to do it alone, it would be even better if you do
         it with someone more experienced.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Taking cocaine in excessive amounts can cause heart attacks, seizures
        or death. In the case that you overdose, do not doubt to call the
        ambulance service, you will not get into any trouble. Here are some of
        the symptoms that people show:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><span>Disorganised behaviour</span></li>
        <li><span>Fear</span></li>
        <li><span>Paranoia, suspiciousness</span></li>
        <li><span>Haluucinations</span></li>
        <li><span>Irritability and aggressiveness, often panic attacks </span></li>
        <li><span>Some people can become extremely antisociable</span></li>
        <li><span>
          In extreme cases, stroke, seizures, pulmonary oedema, aorta rupture
          heart attack or death can occur
        </span></li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Snorting only through one nostril can cause bleeding and build up. Try
        alternating between the two nostrils and washing them with water.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
{% endblock %}

{% block harm-reduction-stage-3 %}
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        Cocaine can make you feel on top of the world and one of the reasons
        people becoming addicted to it, is the temptation to do it over and
        over again once the effect has worn off. It has also been shown that
        frequent cocaine use dramatically reduces the blood reaching the brain
        and may lead to brain damage or dysfunction. Like any other drug, we
        advise you not to binge and keep your cocaine consumption for special
        occasion.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        You might find it hard to fall asleep after taking cocaine. It also
        suppresses your appetite, so try to drink plenty of water the next
        day and have a health and nutritious breakfast, loaded with proteins
        fibres and carbohydrates, even if you are not hungry.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Never take more cocaine to overcome the hangover!</p>

  <h3>Dependence</h3>
  <p>
    Cocaine is one of the most addictive recreational drugs (graph). While
    chewing coca leaf hardly generates addiction, smoked cocaine is one of the
    most addictive drug habits. This is explained by the speed it reaches the
    brain and the time the high lasts.
  </p>
  <p>
    Even though cocaine is classified as highly addictive it does not mean you
    will get hooked with the first trial. 18% of users of cocaine have been
    seen to become addicted to it. However, limit its consumption for very
    special occasion and never introduce it in your daily lifestyle.
  </p>
  <p class="side-note">
    Please read <a href="/me">ME</a> for more general information about recreational drugs.
  </p>
  <p>
    Snorting is the most common way of consuming it. After chewing coca leaf,
    it is the least addictive way contrary to what many people think. Crack
    users are more prone to get into habitual use and addiction. Injecting
    solved cocaine in water is the most harmful way to do it.

  <h3>FAQS</h3>
  <h4>People can get addicted with just one try</h4>
  <p>
    This is not true for any drug. Addiction is a complex disorder that it is
    still not fully understood. It relies on many different factors such as
    the times a particular drug is consumed, the quantity used, the family
    history of mental health, social interactions.
