    MDMA is a stimulant-hallucinogenic research chemical. <strong>MDMA</strong> is not the same

  <h3>How? How much? When? For how long?</h3>
  <div class="side-note">

      information.

    As with any drug, the correct dose for you depends on factors such as
    weight, gender, metabolism, whether you have taken the drug recently or
    not, amongst many others.
  </p>
  <h3>How you take it matters...</h3>
  <p>
    MDMA usually comes in a powder or pill form, and is ingested orally.
    However, it is also sometimes taken nasally, but this is not recommended,
    as it decreases the length of the experience, cause nasal pain and can
    cause a more severe comedown.
  </p>
  <h3>How much?</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <span><strong>Small/sensitive people:</strong> 60-90mg</span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <span><strong>Recommended dose for most people:</strong> 75-125mg</span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <span><strong>Large/less sensitive people:</strong> 110-150mg</span>

  <p>
    <strong>WARNING:</strong> pills in the UK and Europe contain a very high concentration of
    MDMA. This can lead to accidental overdoses. We recommend that you <strong>try half a pill first</strong> as it
    might have much more MDMA than you expect.
  </p>
  <h3>How often can I take it?</h3>
        <p><strong>The Three Month Rule</strong></p>
  <p>
    MDMA works by causing large amounts of serotonin to be released, along with other neurotransmitters like dopamine.
      After using MDMA, your serotonin levels are lowered, and it takes <a href="https://dancesafe.org/drug-information/ecstasy-slideshow/">
      a long time</a> for your brain to build more serotonin.
      If you take ecstasy <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/xihdo/rdrugs_ama_series_mdma_aka_ecstasy_e_x_molly/">
        on a regular basis</a>, you may be releasing and depleting your serotonin
        before it has a chance to fully replenish itself.
        This means you will be operating on lower-than-normal serotonin levels
        most of the time, and this can <a href="http://www.bmj.com/content/350/bmj.h1771">
          lead to depression</a> or worsen depressive symptoms.
      It is recommended that you leave <strong>at the very least 1–2 months</strong>
      between uses, <strong>ideally 3</strong>.
    Save MDMA for special occasions or events only, and use it very sparingly.
  </p>
     <p><strong>Tolerance and loss of effecctiveness</strong></p>
         <p>
     Just as if you take too high a dose,<a href="https://www.globaldrugsurvey.com/dosing-for-pleasure-and-why-less-is-often-more/">
      consuming MDMA too often</a> also seems to produce an irreversible
      loss of potency.

{% block harm-reduction-content %}
  <p class="side-note">
    Head over to our <a href="/me">ME</a> section if you would like to know
    more about harm reduction.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are certain precautions you should take before using MDMA. The
    advice below helps to prepare you both physically and mentally. We want you
    to be safe and enjoy your experience as much as possible, so if you have a
    bad experience or are struggling with especially bad after-effects,
    please take note of the advice below.
  </p>
{% endblock %}

{% block harm-reduction-stage-1 %}
<h3>Test the drug</h3>
<p>
  Dealers can mix other chemicals, from caffeine to methamphetamine, into MDMA and ecstasy.
  We recommend that you always test your pills using a
  <a href="https://www.eztestkits.com/en/most-popular/ecstasy-drug-testing-kit">drug testing kit</a>.
    Depending on the country you're in, there are places where you can
    <a href="https://www.ecstasydata.org/send_sample.php">send samples of your pills</a> to be tested.
    Another recommended source is <a href="http://www.pillreports.net/">Pill Reports</a>,
    where you can search for an ecstasy pill by its stamp and appearance.
    However, this is not a foolproof way to making sure that your pills are safe.
    <a href="http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/glasgow-nightclub-arches-stay-open-3244159">
    Read this article</a> about a teenager in Glasgow who died after taking a rogue
    version of a widely-used pill.
</p>
<p>
  Accidental deaths have occurred due to ingesting compounds such as
  <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/shortcuts/2013/jul/22/pma-not-another-drug-scare-story">PMMA in a pill that was thought to be MDMA</a>.
  We know some people cannot be bothered to test, but it is becoming
  increasingly important to do this in order to stay safe.
</p>
{% endblock %}

{% block harm-reduction-stage-2 %}
  <h3>Take a break from dancing</h3>
  <p>
    MDMA can change your body temperature regulation, while dancing increases your body temperature. These combined
    can lead to heat stroke, so take a break from dancing from time to time to
    cool down.
  </p>
  <h3>Avoid re-dosing</h3>
  <p>
    A common mistake which can lead to a bad experience (or even to hospitalisation)
    is taking another dose of MDMA because the first one did not have an effect.
    This leads to ‘coming up’ twice as hard, which is very dangerous. MDMA
    takes a long time to digest and absorb, so be patient, and wait for it to
    kick in.
  </p>
  <h3>Emergencies and overdosing</h3>
  <p>
    How to know if someone took an overdose:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>Vomiting</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Headaches</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Dizziness</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Serotonin syndrome</strong>: increased heart rate, shivering, twitching,
        over-responsive reflexes, extremely high temperatures
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Do not doubt to call a paramedic if you feel any of these symptoms. You will
    not get into trouble.
  </p>
  <p>
    Be careful with <a href="#interactions">drug interactions</a>.
  </p>
{% endblock %}

{% block harm-reduction-stage-3 %}
  <p>
    The MDMA hangover, or comedown, varies from person to person and is
    dependent on the amount taken. The effects can also last from 1 up to 14
    days after use.
  </p>
  <p>The after-effects include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>Fuzzy memory</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Decrease in attention or difficulty concentrating </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Some people feel happier in general and more focused.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Mild to strong depression</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Some people experience a ‘loss of magic’ after using MDMA after a couple of uses,
    meaning the drug doesn’t feel as good as the first few times. However, this does not
    happen to all people. If MDMA is taken on successive days or weeks, then the
     negative and comedown effects are worsened.
  </p>
<h3>Additional harm reduction advice:</h3>
<p>Drink plenty of water before and after, and we also recommend taking vitamin supplements.

  <p>
    <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC81503/">There are studies</a> that indicate brain toxicity can occur after MDMA use.
    However, there is little or no knowledge of what the consequences are.

  <p>
    Most of the <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/xihdordrugs_ama_series_mdma_aka_ecstasy_e_x_molly/">MDMA-related injuries</a> are due to dehydration caused by
    increased sweating and overheating. Make sure to drink water during the
    night, but not too much as too much water can lead to health risks of its
    own.
  </p>
  <h3>Dependence</h3>
  <p>
    MDMA <a href="http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140673607604644/abstract">
      is not as addictive</a> as other stimulants or depressants. However, like
    any other drug, it is possible to become dependant if it becomes a habit.
    Please read our information on dependence in our Essentials page for more
    information.
